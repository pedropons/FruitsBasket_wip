**The first Unity game by Pitimiri&amp;Co.**

This repo contains the needed assets to start a Unity project. Moreover, there's a .zip file containing the already-built project, ready to play.

The game has only been tested on Windows x86. Running on different systems may yield unexpected results.

Oh, and in case you didn't notice yet, this is totally a Work in Progress!
